# MIPS-simulator-of-instructions
This project is to simulate how instructions are implemented in pipeline, and show what happened to registers during certain number of instructions or cylces; 
mips.txt is an example of the hex number of instructions. You can convert your instructions to hex here: https://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~csci320/mips_web/
